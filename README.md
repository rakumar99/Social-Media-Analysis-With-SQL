# Social-Media-Analysis-With-SQL

Project Overview:
This project focuses on creating a foundational social media database, designed for seamless integration with a frontend interface. The database manages various aspects of social media activity, including user data, followers, interests, and public interactions such as post likes, comments, comment likes, hashtags followed, bookmarks, and more.

Key Features:
User Data Management: The database efficiently handles multiple users' profiles, tracking their followers, interests, and interactions on the platform.

Social Interaction Tracking: I have designed the system to track all major social media activities such as likes, comments, and bookmarks, providing a comprehensive view of each user's engagement on the platform.

SQL Queries: Through well-structured SQL queries, I establish the relationships between different entities such as users, posts, and interactions. The queries highlight the connections between social media activities and how they interact with one another.

Optimized Storage: Media files like images and videos are stored in their true form via URLs, ensuring that storage is optimized for scalability without compromising the integrity of the data.

Scalability and Expansion: The database is designed to handle scalability, making it suitable for larger platforms with more users, posts, and activities. Additionally, the design allows for easy expansion to incorporate features like direct messaging, notifications, and more complex functionalities in future iterations.

Query Optimization: My project includes query optimization techniques to improve response times for complex queries, ensuring the database performs efficiently even under heavy loads.

Security Measures: Basic security protocols have been implemented to protect sensitive user data and maintain database integrity, ensuring that user information is handled safely and responsibly.

User Activity Insights: With this database, it's possible to generate insights into user behaviors such as most-liked posts, top-followed hashtags, and most active users, giving the platform administrators the ability to understand trends and engagement metrics.

Error Handling: I have incorporated error handling mechanisms to ensure that missing or incomplete data doesn't disrupt the user experience, contributing to a more robust and reliable system.
